# Features

# Installation

An in-depth installation guide can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/CuriousMike56/RoRServerBot/wiki), along with a [configuration guide](https://github.com/CuriousMike56/RoRServerBot/wiki/Configuration) and a [commands list](https://github.com/CuriousMike56/RoRServerBot/wiki/Commands).

# IRC? Why not Discord?

This bot was originally created in ~2011. At the time, IRC was the only well-known and easy to use platform to build a bot on. Replacing IRC with Discord would require nearly a complete rewrite of the bot. (Contributors are welcome, so feel free to add support yourself and create a pull request! :smile:)

If you wish to control the bot via Discord, you can use a [Discord-IRC bridge bot](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc).
