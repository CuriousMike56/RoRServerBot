<!--
	This is XML, if you don't know XML, look it up.
	It's really easy, if you can host a RoR-server, host an IRC-server,
	host this bot, then I assume that you can read/write XML as well.
	
	There're 3 sections in this file:
	  - The general configuration with some general stuff in it
	  - The IRC configuration
	  - The RoR-server(s) configuration
	Quite self-explanatory.
	
	Minimal configuration:
		<configuration>
			<IRCclient>
				<server host="yourHost" />
			</IRCclient>
			<RoRclients>
				<RoRclient>
					<server host="yourHost" port=somePort />
					<irc channel="#someChannel" />
				</RoRclient>
			</RoRclients>
		</configuration>
	
	note: IRCclient has 3 capitals and RoRclient(s) has 2 capitals. All the rest has no capitals
 -->
