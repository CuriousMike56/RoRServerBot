Hi,

No, this bot isn't finished.
No, this bot will probably never be finished.

Thanks for reading the readme.

By the way,
If you need help with the bot, then ask me via neorej16@rigsofrods.com
Not that I'll guarantee you that I'll reply, but it's worth a try.

This bot was based on a bot, which can be found here:
http://rorserver.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/rorserver/trunk/contrib/tools/
This bot includes a modified version of the python irclib v0.4.8
